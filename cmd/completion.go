Zsh:

# If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
# to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

# To load completions for each session, execute once:
$ yourprogram completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_yourprogram"

# You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Fish:

$ yourprogram completion fish | source

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// completionCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// completionCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
